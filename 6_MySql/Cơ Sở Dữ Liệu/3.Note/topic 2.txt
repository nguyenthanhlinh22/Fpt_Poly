I love and often shop online. But I buy tech stuff on the TikTok page, I'm very hunting for discounts in prime time. I rarely buy things at the market because the food at the market is often high priced and not at the right price. The disadvantage of buying things online will often not know if the goods can be used or not, so it will take a lot of time to return the goods. Those things cost me a lot of time on it, so I will limit online purchases in the future
